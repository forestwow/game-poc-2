# The Understudies

A prototype of a short roguelite for PC. You are a stage magician defending the box office from critics. Each act lasts about a minute, and every act you play leaves behind a cardboard understudy that repeats the route you ran, in every act that follows. Where you run is what you build.

- `docs/vision.md` is the design.
- `docs/plan-prototype.md` is the plan of the prototype and its ticket list.

## Layout

- `src/Understudies.Core`: the rules of the game, with no engine dependency.
- `src/Understudies.Game`: the MonoGame layer (window, input, drawing, sound).
- `tests/Understudies.Core.Tests`: NUnit tests for Core.

## Requirements

The .NET SDK named in `global.json` (10.0.1xx). Nothing else: MonoGame comes from NuGet.

## Running

    dotnet run --project src/Understudies.Game

WASD, the arrows or a gamepad's left stick walk the magician. Esc quits.

To look at a frame without playing, the game can walk a fixed script for a number of ticks (60 a second), save the frame it ends on and exit:

    dotnet run --project src/Understudies.Game -- --capture frame.png --ticks 120

## Tests

    dotnet test Understudies.sln --configuration Release
